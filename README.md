### 2. Notification System
A robust Notification System has been set-up to inform all users involved in the Delivery Cycle to receive a notification suitable to the status of the Order.
* Orders go through 4 stages in the entire Delivery Cycle - 
  1. Placed, 
  2. Dispatched, 
  3. In Transit
  4. Delivered. 
These stages can be tracked using the Notification System. 
* By clicking on any of the notification, the user gets to view the order details and the order status simultaneously in a separate window.
